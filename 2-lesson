Connect to the Database
If you have followed the steps from the Install PostgreSQL page, you now have a PostgreSQL database on you computer.
There are several ways to connect to the database, we will look at two ways in this tutorial:
-> SQL Shell (psql)
-> pgAdmin 4

1. SQL Shell (psql)
- find the SQL Shell (psql) tool
- Insert the name of the server. [localhost]
- Insert the name of the database. [postgresql]
- Insert the name of the port. [5432]
- Insert the name of the username. [postgresql]
- Enter the password you chose when you installed the PostgreSQL database: -------
-> The result might look like an error, but if it shows psql (15.2) or any other version, and in the end you see the postgres=# command (and maybe a warning in between), then you have successfully connected to the database!
- Result: postgres=# 
- we can start executing SQL statements. for example: SELECT version();

2. pgAdmin 4
- choose the pgAdmin 4
- choose the password
- choose the [Server] option 
- insert the password
- Click on the [Database] option on in the menu
- Open Query Tool than: You should find a database named postgres, right-click it choose the "Query Tool":
- In the Query Tool we can start executing SQL statements. for example: SELECT version();
- click the Plya button and you can see the result in the "Data Output" area:


I prefer to use the next one.
